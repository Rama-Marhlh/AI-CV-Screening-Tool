```

## üíª Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Navigate to the displayed local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Use the application:
   - Upload resumes (PDF format)
   - Enter job description
   - Set matching criteria and weights
   - Process and analyze resumes
   - View results and comparisons
   - Export analysis results

## üìä Analysis Components

### Resume Processing
- PDF text extraction
- Language detection
- Structure parsing
- Data normalization

### Scoring System
- Content similarity using BERT embeddings
- Skills matching
- Location alignment
- Experience evaluation
- Education qualification matching

### Visualization
- Interactive dashboards
- Comparison charts
- Distribution graphs
- Detailed candidate profiles

## üîß Configuration

The application supports various configuration options:

- Model settings:
  - Using multilingual-e5-large-instruct model
  - Configurable chunk sizes for text processing
  
- Parser settings:
  - API endpoint configuration
  - Response handling preferences

- Export settings:
  - CSV export options
  - JSON report configuration

## ü§ù API Integration

The system integrates with an external CV parsing API:
- Endpoint: https://ai.kayanhr.com/cvparse
- Authentication: Required
- Format: JSON
- API for configuration: Allows dynamic adjustment of parsing and scoring parameters
- **Production API**: A Flask-based API is required for production deployment, enabling scalable and efficient processing

## üí¨ Chat System

The application includes a chat interface that enables querying the resume database using natural language. We use the `deepseek-r1` model for chat responses:
```python
# Get response from model
response = ollama.chat(
    model='deepseek-r1',
    messages=messages,
    stream=False
)
```
To use `deepseek-r1`, install the Ollama package and ensure it's properly configured:
```bash
pip install ollama
```

## üåç Using multilingual-e5-large-instruct Model

This model is used for multilingual processing and resume matching. To download and use it:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct')
```
Install the required package:
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers
```

## üì± Responsive Design

The interface adapts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Full feature set
- Tablet: Optimized layouts
- Mobile: Essential features

## üõ† Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. PDF Extraction Fails:
   - Ensure PDF is not password protected
   - Check for proper UTF-8 encoding
